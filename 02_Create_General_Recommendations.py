# Databricks notebook source
# MAGIC %md The purpose of this notebook is to connect to an LLM in order to create generalized product recommendations.  This notebook was developed on a Databricks ML 14.2 cluster.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Introduction
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The next step in building our recommender is to tap into the power of a general purpose large language model (LLM) to suggest additional items for a user.  Given knowledge of the items a customer has purchased, browsed or otherwise expressed interest in, the LLM can tap a resevoir of knowledge to suggest what items would typically be associated with these.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The steps involved with getting this part of the application stood app are simply to connect to an appropriate LLM and tune a prompt that returns the right results in the right format.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Install Required Libraries
# MAGIC %pip install databricks-genai-inference
# MAGIC
# MAGIC dbutils.library.restartPython()

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Get Config Settings
# MAGIC %run "./00_Intro_and_Config"

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Import the Required Libraries
from databricks_genai_inference import ChatCompletion

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Step 1: Connect to the LLM
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With the availability of a wide variety of proprietary services and open source models, we have numerous options for how we will address our LLM needs. Many frequently used models have been pre-provisioned for use within Databricks as part of our [foundation model APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html).  This includes [Meta's Llama2-70B-Chat model](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) which is being widely adopted as a robust, general-purpose chat enabler.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because all the plumbing has already been put in place, connectivity to this model is very simple.  We just make the call:

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Text Connectivity to the LLM
response = ChatCompletion.create(
  model='llama-2-70b-chat',
  messages=[
    {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'},
    {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Knock knock.'}
    ],
  max_tokens=128
  )

print(f'response.message:{response.message}')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ##Step 2:  Engineer the prompt
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The foundation model API greatly simplifies the process of not only connecting to a model but performing a chat task. Instead of constructing a prompt with specialized formatting, we can assemble a fairly standard [chat message payload](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/api-reference.html#chat-task) to generate a response.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As is typical in most chat applications, we will supply a system prompt and a user prompt.  The system prompt for our app might look like this:

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Define System Prompt
system_prompt = 'You are an AI assistant functioning as a recommendation system for an ecommerce website. Be specific and limit your answers to the requested format. Keep your answers short and concise.'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md For the user prompt, we need to incorporate a list of items from which product recommendations will be produced.  Because this prompt is dynamic, it might be best to define the prompt using a function:

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Define Function to Build User Prompt
# define function to create prompt produce a recommended set of products
def get_user_prompt(ordered_list_of_items):

   # assemble user prompt
  prompt = None
  if len(ordered_list_of_items) > 0:
    items = ', '.join(ordered_list_of_items)
    prompt =  f"A user bought the following items: {items}. What next ten items would he/she be likely to purchase next?"
    prompt += " Express your response as a JSON object with a key of 'next_items' and a value representing your array of recommended items."
 
  return prompt

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Retrieve User Prompt
# get prompt and results
user_prompt = get_user_prompt(
    ['scarf', 'beanie', 'ear muffs', 'thermal underwear']
    )

print(user_prompt)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md And now we can test the prompt with a call to our LLM:

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Test the Prompt
response = ChatCompletion.create(
  model='llama-2-70b-chat',
  messages=[
    {'role': 'system', 'content': system_prompt},
    {'role': 'user','content': user_prompt}
    ],
  max_tokens=128
  )
print(f'response.message:{response.message}')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Getting the model to respond with lists in the structure  you want and with relevant content is tricky.  (For example, we couldn't get a valid dictionary structure by requesting a python dictionary but found that requesting a JSON object did the trick.) You'll need to experiment with a variety of wordings and phrasings to trigger the right results.
